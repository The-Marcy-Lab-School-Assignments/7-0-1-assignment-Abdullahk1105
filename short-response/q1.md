# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts?

# Answer

The first argument is the effect function, which runs after the component has rendered. The second argument is an optional dependency array, which lists the values on which the effect depends on. When any value in this array changes, the effect is triggered again.It runs after each render, if it is empty it runs onceÂ only after the first render.
