# Question

What are the two arguments that `useEffect` accepts?

# Answer

The first argument is the effect function, which runs after the component has rendered. The second argument is an optional dependency array, which lists the values on which the effect depends on. When any value in this array changes, the effect is triggered again.It runs after each render, if it is empty it runs onceÂ only after the first render.

Great job! You provided a thorough explanation of both arguments that useEffect accepts. You accurately described the effect function and the dependency array, along with the behavior when the array is empty. This shows a solid understanding of how useEffect works
