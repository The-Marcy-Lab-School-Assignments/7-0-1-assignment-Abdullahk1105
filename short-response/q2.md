# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

1. We can use a empty dependency array, when we do this the `useEffect` only runs once after the first page render.
   Example:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("hello world");
}, []); // this will only run once
```

2. We can use the callback with out a dependency array, this makes it so that the `useEffect` callback will run after every render.

Example:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("hello world");
});
```

3. We can use dependency arrays with variables such as our states and props, and the `useEffect` callback only runs when those variables change.

Example:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("hello world");
}, [someProp, someState]);
```
